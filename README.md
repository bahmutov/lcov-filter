## Use

    npm install lcov-filter --save-dev
    node node_modules/lcov-filter/index.js <lcov.info> <filenames to exclude>

    -- filename to exclude is used as RegExp

Filtered result is printed to STDOUT and can be piped to other tools, for example
to send to coveralls.io

## Example

Pipe file *cover/lcov.info* and remove info for files that contain word *test* in the path,
the output is then piped through [coveralls](https://github.com/cainus/node-coveralls) module

    node node_modules/lcov-filter/index.js cover/lcov.info test | ./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js

## Why?

I love testing and code coverage, and send coverage results
to [coveralls.io](http://bahmutov.calepin.co/code-coverage-via-gt-and-coveralls.html),
which gives me nice badges. The problem is that sending combined code coverage for
the soure code AND unit test code skews the average number upwards:

For example:

* actual code is covered at 80%
* unit test is covered at 100%
* coveralls badge shows respectable, but misleading 90% code coverage

I am using *lcov-filter* to filter out test files from the code coverage
before sending to coveralls.io generating more meaningful numbers.
[qunit-promises](https://github.com/bahmutov/qunit-promises) is one example
that now reports only code coverage without adding tests.
